## Troubleshooting

### "Authorization required" every time
- Script properties might not be saved
- Re-add API keys in Project Settings ‚Üí Script Properties

### No email received
1. Check spam folder
2. Check Error_Log sheet
3. Verify EMAIL_RECIPIENTS in Config sheet
4. Run "Test Email Delivery" from menu

### "Missing API Key" error
- Go to Apps Script ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Script Properties
- Make sure BOTH keys are there:
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - OPENAI_API_KEY

### Articles generated but low quality
- Check CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD in Config (should be 90)
- Check Error_Log for validation failures
- May need to add more URLs to Website_URLs sheet

### Thumbnails not generated
- Check OpenAI API credits
- DALL-E 3 costs $0.04 per image
- Error will be in Error_Log sheet

### Script takes too long / times out
- Google Apps Script has 6-minute limit per execution
- Script is optimized to run in ~2-3 minutes
- If timing out, check Error_Log

### Want to change generation time
1. Open Config sheet
2. Change DAILY_TRIGGER_HOUR value
3. Run "Setup Daily Trigger" again from menu

### Want to generate more than 2 articles
1. Open Config sheet
2. Change ARTICLES_PER_DAY
3. Note: Will increase API costs proportionally

## Advanced Configuration

### Adding More URLs to Scrape

Want to scrape more pages?

1. Open **Website_URLs** sheet
2. Add rows:
   ```
   URL                                          | Active | Last Scraped
   https://www.sherrodsportsvisas.com/new-page | true   |
   ```

### Changing Email Recipients

1. Open **Config** sheet
2. Find EMAIL_RECIPIENTS row
3. Edit value (Column B)
4. Format: `email1@example.com,email2@example.com,email3@example.com`
5. Changes take effect on next run

### Adjusting Quality Threshold

Default is 90% confidence. To change:

1. Open **Config** sheet
2. Find CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
3. Change value (90 = 90%, 95 = 95%, etc.)
4. Higher = stricter (may cause more retries)
5. Lower = more lenient (may reduce quality)

Recommended: 90-95%

### Word Count Limits

Current: 1500-3000 words per article

To change:
1. Open **Config** sheet
2. Edit MIN_WORD_COUNT and/or MAX_WORD_COUNT
3. Longer articles = higher API costs

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Check Generation History
**Content_Archive** sheet shows:
- All generated articles
- When created
- Quality scores
- Execution IDs

### Check for Errors
**Error_Log** sheet shows any failures.

From menu:
- **üìä View Archive** - Opens Content_Archive
- **‚ùå View Error Log** - Opens Error_Log

### Verify Name Usage
**Verified_Names** sheet tracks:
- Which names are used
- How many times
- Last usage date

## Cost Management

### Typical Monthly Costs

**Daily generation (2 articles + 2 images):**
- Claude API: ~$0.50/day
- OpenAI DALL-E: ~$0.16/day
- Total: ~$0.66/day
- Monthly: ~$20

### Reducing Costs

1. **Generate less frequently:**
   - Change from daily to 3x/week
   - Modify trigger in Apps Script

2. **Reduce articles per day:**
   - Change ARTICLES_PER_DAY in Config
   - 1 article/day = ~$10/month

3. **Disable thumbnails:**
   - Edit script to skip image generation
   - Save ~$5/month

4. **Use shorter articles:**
   - Reduce MAX_WORD_COUNT
   - Less tokens = lower cost

## Best Practices

### Daily Workflow
1. Check email at 4:30 AM EST (or whenever convenient)
2. Download attachments
3. Add logos to thumbnails (5 min)
4. Publish to Squarespace (10 min)
5. Total: 15 min/day

### Weekly Checks
- Review Content_Archive
- Check Error_Log (should be empty)
- Verify articles are publishing correctly
- Monitor website traffic (Squarespace analytics)

### Monthly Maintenance
- Review Verified_Names sheet
- Add any new successful client names
- Check API usage/costs
- Review and archive old content if needed

## Getting Help

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I edit the articles before publishing?**
A: Yes! But they're designed to be publish-ready. Minor edits okay, but shouldn't need much.

**Q: What if I don't like an article?**
A: Regenerate! Just run "Generate Content Now" again. Or edit before publishing.

**Q: Can I use this for other websites?**
A: Yes, but you'd need to customize:
- Website URLs
- Logo URLs
- Example articles
- Verified names

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: Yes! All code runs in YOUR Google account. We don't store or access anything.

**Q: What happens if API goes down?**
A: Error logged in Error_Log sheet, alert email sent. Will retry next scheduled time.
